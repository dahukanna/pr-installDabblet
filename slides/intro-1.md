##  Dabblet, an open-source interactive CSS playground

### What do you need?

1. You need an HTTP webserver and there are also PHP scripts supplied.

    1a. These days, my default HTTP server is [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [HarpJS](http://harpjs.com/) is my default static site server/generator.
    Follow the site links above to install on your target system.

    1b. If you don't want to use these, install any HTTP webserver.
