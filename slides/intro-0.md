### What is Dabblet?
Was watching [Lea Verou](http://lea.verou.me/) - [CSS Conf EU 2015| The missing Slice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVnUDTtOLE0) and I wondered what tool she was using to be able to edit CSS code and show the results instantly.

Doing some unrelated GitHub foraging, I came across **Dabblet** an open-source interactive CSS playground.

You know I've got to try it out.

    Put your speaker notes here.
    You can see them pressing 's'.
